// tests exercise the AI path without injecting the `hookSetup` seam; with a
// real TTY (e.g. an interactive self-hosted CI runner) init would reach the
// Phase 1.65 hooks menu, call collectHookSetup(), and block forever reading
// stdin — which on CI starves the runner until it drops (issue: PR #215 CI hang).
//
// Production is unaffected (this file is test-only). Tests that NEED a TTY drive
// it explicitly through installTtyMock / deps injection, which set their own
// `stdin.isTTY` via a configurable property and restore it afterwards, so this
// baseline never fights them.

// --- Global spawn-integrity guard (test-pollution detector) ---------------
//
// Several tests patch `Bun.spawnSync` / `Bun.spawn` to stub subprocess calls
// and restore them in a `finally`. If a test throws before its restore, or
// forgets one, the patched function leaks into later tests. Because bun
// implements `node:child_process` on top of `Bun.spawnSync`, a leaked stub
// makes innocent tests that shell out (e.g. file-size-gate runs the real
// `check-file-size.cjs`, the `vf --help` cli tests) silently receive the stub
// — producing the order-dependent, non-deterministic failures that have made
// CI flaky.
//
// This guard snapshots the pristine references once, then after every test
// checks whether they still point at the originals. If a leak is found it
// RESTORES the original (so the leak doesn't cascade to the next test) and
// prints a loud warning naming the offending test — turning a mystery flake
// into a deterministic, attributable signal on the very next CI run.
