 */
export const VF_WORKFLOW = `## Working with vf (the loop)
Drive every task through this loop instead of free-handing it:
1. **Sync context.** After editing ${CTX_DIR}/*, run \`vf init\` to regenerate this file and the engine context from canonical sources. Don't hand-edit generated files.
2. **Shape the work.** A single-concern task runs as-is — no ceremony. When the task splits into parallel slices with distinct file scopes, model each as a work unit (\`vf units add <name>\`); status, confidence, and evidence are tracked per unit in the ledger.
3. **Dispatch.** \`vf orchestrate\` plans and dispatches the units, runs an independent review, and records evidence. Work units with overlapping file scopes are serialized automatically so lanes never clobber each other; non-overlapping ones run in parallel.
4. **Verify before claiming done.** \`vf verify\` runs typecheck/lint/test plus the policy gates.

**Confidence gate — nothing is "done" until \`vf verify\` passes.** A unit only closes at confidence = 1.0 WITH recorded evidence (command output, file path, or test result) and within its declared scope. Below the bar, the unit is investigated, not silently closed. No verification, no completion; no evidence, no conclusion.

**Guardrails (hooks) are safety, not bureaucracy.** \`vf hooks\` routes risky actions — destructive commands (\`rm -rf\`, force-push), reads of secret files, edits to protected configs — through a decision layer that can warn, require approval, or block. Keep them on.

**Skills & knowledge before manual steps.** Prefer a verified skill over inventing steps (\`vf skills\` to list/resolve). Read curated guidance in ${CTX_DIR}/knowledge/ before knowledge-heavy work, and pull external library docs on demand with \`vf discover docs <lib> --yes\`. After acting, record what you did or learned: append an entry to \`${CTX_DIR}/knowledge/log.md\` (\`## [YYYY-MM-DD] note | <title>\`, append-only) and keep \`${CTX_DIR}/knowledge/index.md\` current.

**Tools.** \`vf tools enable codegraph|lsp\` turns on richer code navigation (definitions, references, callers) — prefer it over grep/find when available.

**When \`vf verify\` fails.** A red gate is investigated, not worked around. (1) Read the \`✗\` lines — each names a failing gate (typecheck/lint/test) or a policy gate (\`confidence<1\`, \`no-evidence\`, scope overlap). (2) Fix the root cause. (3) For a unit stuck below the bar: record evidence (\`vf units evidence <u> --add "<proof>"\`) then close it (\`vf units update <u> --status done --confidence 1\`). (4) Re-run \`vf verify\`. \`vf verify\` is read-only by default; pass \`--journal\` only if you want the run appended to the work journal.

**When blocked or interrupted.** If a hook returns \`deny\`/\`ask\`, do NOT bypass it — the command is genuinely risky; fix the approach or get approval. If \`vf orchestrate\` crashed mid-run, re-run it (work units track their own status in the ledger, so completed lanes are skipped). Two units editing the same file are serialized automatically; if you need to stop a lane touching a path, see the source-protection toggles in \`vf orchestrate --help\`.

**Default engine.** \`vf init\` and \`vf orchestrate\` share one default (currently \`claude\`); pass \`--engine <claude|codex|copilot>\` to override. Check \`vf doctor\` for which engines are ready before dispatching.

**Iterating on one fix.** \`vf verify\` runs the full suite. While iterating, run a single test (\`bun test test/<file>.test.ts\`) or a single-file lint, then \`vf verify\` once before you call it done.

**Hook enforcement is engine-specific.** The live PreToolUse gate (armed via \`vf hooks emit --yes\`) BLOCKS on Claude. Codex and Copilot hook configs are detection-only (they observe + log, they do not block) — \`vf doctor\` reports per-engine status. Do not assume a destructive command is blocked when driving Codex/Copilot.`;

/**
 * Options for {@link defaultContext}.
