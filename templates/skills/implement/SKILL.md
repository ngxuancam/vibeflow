# implement — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Purpose

Take an implementation-ready specification and produce working code that compiles,
follows project conventions, and passes existing tests. The design has been settled
upstream — this phase is translation, not invention.

## When to Use

- Detail design is approved.
- Code is being created or modified according to spec.
- The team needs a working build to demo or test.

## When NOT to Use

- The design is still changing (re-run detail-design first).
- The change is exploratory (no spec yet, use basic-design).
- The work is pure research (no deliverable code).

## Inputs

| Name | Type | Required | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| `{{INPUT_PATH}}` | file path(s) — detail design + codebase | yes | Detail design + relevant existing source files. |
| `{{TEMPLATE}}` | file path or scaffold | no | Optional code scaffold or template. |
| Project context | auto-discovered | yes | Build/test/lint commands, conventions, stack. |
| Stack skills | auto-discovered | yes | Read `.vibeflow/skills/<stack>/SKILL.md` for stack rules. |

## Execution Logic

1. **Read input** from `{{INPUT_PATH}}` — extract every interface, schema, sequence from the detail design.
2. **Survey existing codebase** — read top-level config, list packages, sample 2-3 similar files for style.
3. **Survey project conventions** — read `.vibeflow/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and stack skills for naming, error handling, logging, persistence patterns.
4. **Plan file changes** — for each spec item: file to create/modify, function/method to add, shared utilities to reuse.
5. **Implement incrementally** — for each file: minimum viable code → compile → fix errors → add next layer; write unit test alongside each new function.
6. **Run project build** — use the build command from `.vibeflow/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Fix all errors before moving on.
7. **Run project tests** — existing test suite. New tests pass; existing tests do not regress.
8. **Self-review** — every spec item implemented, no lint/style violations, no unused imports/dead code.
9. **Verify against DoD** in `.vibeflow/WORKFLOW_STATE.json` (`work_units[name=implement].success_criteria`).
10. **Record evidence** in `.vibeflow/knowledge/log.md` (files changed, build output, test output).

## Outputs

| Name | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Source files | in-repo | New or modified files per detail design. |
| Test files | in-repo | Unit/integration tests alongside code. |
| Evidence log | `.vibeflow/knowledge/log.md` | Build + test output. |

## Constraints

- Do NOT make design decisions — the design is already done.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies without justification in the spec.
- Do NOT skip writing tests for new public functions.
- Do NOT break existing tests (regressions = blocked).
- Do NOT commit secrets, credentials, or `.env` files.

## Guardrails

- **Build guard**: code must compile before phase is marked done.
- **Test guard**: all existing tests must still pass.
- **Convention guard**: new code must match the style of existing code in the same module.
- **DRY guard**: do not duplicate utilities that already exist in the codebase.
- **Spec guard**: do not implement anything outside the spec without flagging it.

## Error Handling

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Build failure | Fix code, do not bypass. Mark blocked if unfixable in scope. |
| Test failure (existing) | Treat as regression, do not modify test to make it pass. Investigate cause. |
| Test failure (new) | Fix the code, not the test (unless test is wrong). |
| Missing dependency | Flag in output, do not silently `npm install` or modify lockfile. |
| Spec ambiguity discovered | Stop, flag in output, return blocked. Re-run detail-design. |
| Out-of-scope bug discovered | Log to evidence, do not fix in this phase. |
