// W-A: map a scoped-gate result onto the four-slot unit gate object.
//
// scopedGate runs typecheck → biome → coverage and SHORT-CIRCUITS on the first
// failure, so the gates AFTER the failing one never ran. A gate that did not
// execute must be reported "pending", NOT "pass" — claiming "pass" for a gate
// that never ran is the exact theater-gate bug W-A exists to fix.
//
// pass-order: build(typecheck) → lint(biome) → test(coverage).
