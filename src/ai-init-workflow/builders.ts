/**
 * Build Phase-2 phase-skill enrichment units. One unit per phase that

 * engine to read the declared input files as STRUCTURAL EXAMPLES,
 * apply the skill-creator methodology, and enrich the per-phase skill
 * file (already generated by Phase 1.5) with a REUSABLE TEMPLATE that
 * captures the transformation pattern (input structure → output
 * structure), NOT the task-specific content.
 *
 * The resulting skill body MUST remain valid for a future task of the
 * same phase type. It MUST NOT embed concrete requirement IDs (e.g.
 * BR-001, AC-032, E-014) or hardcode file paths from the current
 * project. Project/task-specific values are expressed as placeholders
 * (`{{...}}`) that the dispatch layer fills at execution time.
 *
 * These units are dispatched in parallel with the adapter units
 * inside `runAiInitWorkflow`. They do NOT participate in the long
 * orchestrator loop — they run a single AI pass per phase.
 *
 * Phases without input/output paths are skipped here: Phase 1.5 already
 * copied the common template skill for them, and there is nothing
 * project-specific to enrich against.
 *
 * One engine call per `vf init` run: previously this returned N
 * parallel units (one per phase), each spawning its own engine call.
 * With the typical 3-phase workflow that meant 3 separate engine
 * invocations on the same prompt shape — burning rate-limit budget and
 * ballooning wall-clock. The batched unit below packages all phases
 * into a single spec, the engine processes them in one turn, and the
 * reviewer gates on every per-phase skill file existing on disk.
