## [2026-06-11] discovery | release-please integrated for @magicpro97/vibeflow
Replaced manual version-bump flow with Google `release-please` for the npm package.

**Files added**
- `release-please-config.json` — single-package `node` config; `package-name: @magicpro97/vibeflow`; `bump-minor-pre-major: false`, `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major: false`, `include-component-in-tag: false` (tag = `vX.Y.Z`, not `package-vX.Y.Z`); 10 changelog sections (feat/fix/perf/refactor/docs/build/ci/test/chore) with `chore` hidden.
- `.release-please-manifest.json` — `{ ".": "0.3.17" }` to seed the bot at current version (matches `package.json` exactly).

**Files modified**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — added `release-please` job (only on push to main, NOT on PRs); permissions `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`. The `check` job is untouched and still gates typecheck/lint/test/build/smoke/e2e.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — changed trigger from `push.paths: package.json` to `pull_request: types: [closed]` + `workflow_dispatch` (manual fallback). Added job-level guard: runs only when `pull_request.merged == true` AND label `autorelease:pending` is present (release-please bot adds this label; the bot also removes it on a normal non-release PR merge, so this guard naturally short-circuits unrelated merges). Inner steps (npm version check, install/check/build, publish with provenance, tag + push tag) are unchanged.

**Verification (real command output)**
- `node -e "JSON.parse(...)"` passes for both JSON files.
- `release-please-config.json` payload: 691 chars, valid JSON.
- `.release-please-manifest.json` payload: `{ ".": "0.3.17" }`.
- `npx yaml-lint .github/workflows/{release,ci}.yml` → PASS ("✔ YAML Lint successful").
- `npx actionlint .github/workflows/{release,ci}.yml` → PASS (exit 0, no output).
- `action.yml` of `googleapis/release-please-action@v4` confirmed: input name is `token` (not `github-token`), action auto-discovers `release-please-config.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json` at repo root with no extra inputs needed.
- `yamllint` (Python) reports line-length warnings on lines 81–170 chars — these are stylistic and pre-existed in the original `release.yml`; the canonical Actions linter `actionlint` is clean.

**Caveats / points of attention**
- Conventional Commits mapping (`feat`/`fix`/`feat!`/`BREAKING`) is now the SOLE bump driver. The repo's commit history is not retroactively rescanned — first release from this setup will be whatever the next `feat:` / `fix:` / `BREAKING` PR triggers.
- `release-please` job runs ONLY on `push` to `main` (not on PRs), so it does not consume PR CI quota.
- After the first Release PR is opened, merging it triggers `release.yml` (PR closed + `autorelease:pending` label present). The `id-token: write` permission is still required for `npm publish --provenance` (Sigstore OIDC).
- Token `NPM_TOKEN` must remain valid in repo secrets; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used by release-please (no PAT needed).
- The bot creates the Release PR from a **branch in the same repo** (default `fork: false`), named like `release-please--branches--main`. First run may take 30–60s to compute the next version.

## [2026-06-11] logbus | M1.5 — must-fixes applied; codemod rolled out — BLOCKED on test regression
- 3 must-fixes applied (src/logbus.ts, test/logbus.test.ts):
  - Real concurrent test: 2 `Logbus` instances, distinct runIds, same dir, 50 interleaved writes, all lines parse, no duplicate seqs per runId. PASSES.
  - Dead `rotate()`: now `async rotate(): Promise<void>`, properly awaits `lockfile.lock()` with same retry/stale params, wraps `rotateLocked()` in try/finally with `release()`. JSDoc added.
  - `stale: 10_000` → `stale: 2_000` (both occurrences: writeLocked + new rotate). 2s window: short for fast M2 CLI, long for graceful exit.
- New `rotate() is async, acquires the lock, and creates a fresh current.log.1` test added (covers the new async path).
- Codemod applied to `src/commands.ts` (185 console.* → 187 out()) and `src/cli.ts` (7 console.* → 7 out()). 0 console.* remaining in either file. Exactly one `import { out } from "./logbus.js";` at top of each.
- **BLOCKED on test regression**: 32 failures vs 3 baseline — 29 NEW regressions from the codemod. Root cause: `out()` writes to **process.stderr** when no bus is active, but tests that spawn the CLI capture **process.stdout** expecting `console.log`-style output. The reviewer-approved codemod is semantically correct (substitutes logging path) but breaks every test that asserts on stdout content (cli help routing, orchestrate source-protection gate, workflow command, etc.).
- Gates observed at this checkpoint:
  - `bunx tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN
  - `bunx biome check src test scripts` — CLEAN (after `--write`)
  - `bun audit` — no vulns
  - `bun test` — 441 pass / 32 fail (was 468 pass / 3 fail before codemod)
- ESCALATION to orchestrator: must decide path forward before continuing. Three options: (a) update `out()` to write to stdout (preserves user-visible behavior, contradicts logbus design), (b) revert the codemod and ship without it (defer M1.5's logging migration), (c) update the 29 affected tests to assert on stderr / the logbus file. Each has a different cost — please pick one and re-dispatch.
- M2 readiness: depends on the above decision.

## [2026-06-11] logbus | M1.5 Option A applied
- out() no-bus fallback routes level:info → console.log (stdout), level:warn|error|debug → console.error (stderr)
- Strip [vf] prefix for stdout (user-facing); keep [channel] for stderr (diagnostic); non-vf channels keep prefix on both streams
- Uses console.log/console.error (NOT raw process.stdout/stderr.write) so test mocks that replace console.log/console.error capture the fallback — production routing is identical because Node's console.* writes to the corresponding stream
- Codemod-shaped `{ level: ... }` options bag is extracted from the last variadic arg; the rest are joined with single spaces (console.log semantics preserved)
- Updated test/out.test.ts and test/logbus.test.ts to assert on console.log/console.error (mocks) instead of process.stdout/stderr.write (raw streams), and to expect the new prefix/stream routing
- 29 codemod-induced regressions resolved (all cli.test.ts out-routing assertions now pass)
- Total: 472 pass, 3 pre-existing fail (all in commands.tools — same names as pre-codemod baseline)
- Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit clean; bunx biome check src test scripts clean
- Ready for M2 (dispatch.ts stderr pipe)

## [2026-06-11] logbus | M0-M1.5 checkpoint — shipped
- All logbus code committed and pushed to origin/main in 3f3cad6 (release: v0.3.18) and surrounding context commits. Logbus is in the production tree.
- Implementation: src/logbus.ts (Logbus class with writer, rotate, prune, cross-process lock), src/logbus-watcher helper, out() variadic helper
- Codemod: scripts/codemod-console-to-out.ts (jscodeshift) + scripts/apply-codemod-m1.5.ts runner
- 185 console.* sites replaced with out("vf", ...) in src/commands.ts; 7 in src/cli.ts
- 33 new tests (test/logbus.test.ts 16, test/out.test.ts 7, test/logbus-watcher.test.ts 5, test/codemod.test.ts 5) — all 33 pass
- Cross-process serialization via proper-lockfile@^4.1.2 (POSIX + Windows); in-process via single Promise chain
- 2 MB rotation threshold, 5 rotated copies, 7-day / 500 MB retention
- chmod 0o600 on every new file (logs may contain engine output secrets)
- Deliverable: .vibeflow/logs/current.log (JSONL with runId, seq, ts, level, channel, msg)
- Working tree: only `.vibeflow/ai-context/project-profile.json` (e2e-advisory auto-regen) left unstaged per user instruction
- M2 (dispatch.ts stderr pipe → bus) is unblocked

## [2026-06-11] logbus | M2 — engine stderr pipe to bus
- src/dispatch.ts: stdio ["pipe","pipe","inherit"] → ["pipe","pipe","pipe"]; AsyncSpawnerOpts gains onStderrChunk; stderr accumulated internally (not in public AsyncSpawner shape)
- src/commands.ts: per-unit streamSpawner + orchestrator + launchEngine spawners all wire onStderrChunk to bus as out("engine-stderr", text, { level:"warn", unit, meta:{engine, unit} }); out("engine-stdout", ...) added for symmetry
- src/logbus.ts: out() now forwards unit + meta from the trailing options bag (extractOptsAndParts); "vf" channel is tee'd to console for backward compat (existing test mocks + CLI rendering), engine-*/user/hook channels are bus-only (M2 contract: stderr no longer leaks to TTY)
- installLogbus() called at top of orchestrate() and run() so engine-stderr bytes always land on the bus (deliberately NOT in main() so vf --help / version keep their stdout rendering)
- test/dispatch-stderr.test.ts: 6 new tests — stdout onChunk, stderr onStderrChunk, bus routing at level=warn, ordered stdout/stderr interleaving, engine+unit in meta, JSONL persistence on disk
- 481 pass / 0 fail (475 baseline + 6 new); no regressions
- Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit clean, bunx biome check src test clean
- M3 (SSE endpoint + createReadStream from current.log) unblocked — the bus already has a watchLogbus watcher and subscribers are wired; the missing piece is the HTTP route that tails the file

## [2026-06-11] logbus | M3 — SSE endpoint + replay endpoints
- src/server.ts: `/api/logs/stream` SSE endpoint that uses `Logbus.subscribe()` for live events, catch-up replay from current.log at connect time, 25s heartbeat, cleanup on disconnect
- src/server.ts: `/api/logs/recent?since=&limit=` JSON endpoint for replay on reconnect
- src/server.ts: `replayFromLog()` helper — reads current.log, filters by seq, caps at limit, handles files >2MB by reading only the tail
- src/server.ts: old `/events` endpoint kept as-is (marked `DEPRECATED in v0.4`)
- test/sse-stream.test.ts: 7 new tests — subscribe/unsubscribe, recent endpoint filtering, SSE headers + initial comment, catch-up events, live event delivery, old endpoint backward compat
- No changes to src/logbus.ts: `subscribe()` already returns `() => void` ✅
- Total: 488 pass / 0 fail (481 baseline + 7 new)
- Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit clean, bunx biome check src test clean
